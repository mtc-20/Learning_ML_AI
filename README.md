## Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains my first Machine Learning Projects, forked from [Quang](https://github.com/quangnhat185/Machine_learning_projects). 
If the notebooks don't load directly from github, you can use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). Belows are brief descriptions and images about the projects: 

- [**Dog and Cat classification project**](https://github.com/mtc-20/Machine_learning_projects/blob/MTC/Dog_Cat_classification/CatDogModel.ipynb)  
  - Dataset: http://bit.ly/30k1jgs contains 25,000 images of dog and cat collected from Internet. 
  - Model: This categorical classification model consists of 3 convolution layers, generating 9,563,970 parameters, and has an accuracy of 86.64%. 
  The image belows shows a sample classification peformed by the model, an error of 3/25 (~12%).

 - [**Fuel Efficiency prediction project**]()
    - Dataset: 
    - This model contains Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression and Gradient Boosting Regressor

<!-- **Fashion classification with fashion_mnnist datasets of Keras**: (Notebook link:  https://github.com/quangnhat185/Machine_learning_projects/blob/master/Fashion_classification/Fashion_classification.ipynb)
  - Dataset: The fashion_mnist datasets of Keras contains of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples
  - My model consists of 597,786 parameters and was trained for 10 epochs. The accuracy is nearly 95%

- **Traffic classisfication with YOLOv3**: (Notebook link: https://github.com/quangnhat185/Machine_learning_projects/blob/master/Traffic_classification/Traffic_classification_YOLOv3.ipynb)
  - Dataset: COCO dataset is a large-scale object-detection dataset which contains of approximately 330K images. 
  - In this project, I applied YOLOv3 algorithm on the dataset of COCO and pass an image and video through. The results can be seen as below figures:
