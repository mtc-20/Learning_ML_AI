# Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains my first Machine Learning Projects, forked from [@quangnhat185 's Machine_learning_projects](https://github.com/quangnhat185/Machine_learning_projects). 
<br>If the notebooks don't load directly from github, you can use [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

## [**Dog and Cat classification project**](https://github.com/mtc-20/Machine_learning_projects/tree/MTC/Dog_Cat_classification)  
  - Dataset: http://bit.ly/30k1jgs contains 25,000 images of dog and cat collected from the internet and sorted into corresponding folders. 
  - Model: This categorical classification model consists of 3 convolution layers, generating 9,563,970 parameters, and has an accuracy of 86.64%. 
  <br>The image belows shows a sample classification peformed by the model, an error of 3/25 (~12%).

## [**Fuel Efficiency prediction project**](https://github.com/mtc-20/Machine_learning_projects/tree/MTC/Fuel_efficiency_prediction)
- Dataset: [Here](https://github.com/mtc-20/Machine_learning_projects/blob/MTC/Fuel_efficiency_prediction/auto-mpg.csv)
- Model: This [file](https://github.com/mtc-20/Machine_learning_projects/blob/MTC/Fuel_efficiency_prediction/FE_prediction.ipynb) contains Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression and Gradient Boosting Regression models, all of them with test scores of +85%.

### Coming Up
 - **House Pricing prediction project** : Based on the Boston House price dataset, while this doesn't exactly cover anything radically new, it has some nice data visualizations.


<!-- **Fashion classification with fashion_mnnist datasets of Keras**: (Notebook link:  https://github.com/quangnhat185/Machine_learning_projects/blob/master/Fashion_classification/Fashion_classification.ipynb)
  - Dataset: The fashion_mnist datasets of Keras contains of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples
  - My model consists of 597,786 parameters and was trained for 10 epochs. The accuracy is nearly 95%

- **Traffic classisfication with YOLOv3**: (Notebook link: https://github.com/quangnhat185/Machine_learning_projects/blob/master/Traffic_classification/Traffic_classification_YOLOv3.ipynb)
  - Dataset: COCO dataset is a large-scale object-detection dataset which contains of approximately 330K images. 
  - In this project, I applied YOLOv3 algorithm on the dataset of COCO and pass an image and video through. The results can be seen as below figures:
